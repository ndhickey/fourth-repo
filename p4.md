A Comparison of the Variety Expansion Model and the Romer Model
================

This is a presentation on the salient features of the assumptions of the models and their implications.

----------

- Considering the Assumptions
- Following the Procedure for the Production Variety Model
- Relevant empirical evidence

----------

**To begin, only consider differing assumptions**
Agents derive utility only in the form $$u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\epsilon}}{1-\epsilon}$$ 
Fixed Labour supply $L$ , redistributed between the process of manufacturing the final good $L_1$ and research $L_2$ so $L_1+ L_2=L$

---------

**Final good-production function at each date**
$$ Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i $$

----------

Now, let $X_t$ be the total amount of final good used in producing intermediate products. Because of the one-one technology 
$$ X_t = \int_0^{M_t}\mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i $$

---------

Hp: each intermediate product is produced in the same amount $x$

Then:

$$ Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{\frac{X_t}{M_t}}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i = M_t^{1-\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}X_t^\alpha $$

--------

The economy's GDP is final output minus the amount used in the intermediate production 

$$
GDP_t= Y_t-X_t
$$

-------

The monopolist pertaining to each intermediate product maximizes profits at each date, such that  
$$
\Pi_i = \rho_i x_i - x_i
$$
where $\rho_i$ is the price in units of final good and the costs per output are unitary. 
 
-------

Note: In a perfectly competitive market the price is equal to the marginal product thus we can rewrite the profit function that monopolists' try to maximize as

$$
\Pi_i = \alpha L^{1-\alpha}x_i^\alpha-x_i
$$

--------

Therefore, the optimal quantity produced will be
$$
x=L\alpha^{\frac{.2}{1-\alpha}}
$$

-------

The equilibrium profit flow is therefore, 

$$
\Pi= \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}L\alpha^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}
$$

-------

Introducing $M_t$ as the measure of product variety we can substitute $X_t = M_t x$ to get the production function $$\begin{aligned} Y_t = M+t L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha\end{aligned}$$ 

------

Moreover, GDP is now
$GDP_t = M_t (L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha - x)$ 

--------

The growth rate of GDP is now $$\begin{aligned} 
g = \frac{1}{M_t} \frac{dM_t}{dt}\end{aligned}$$ 

--------

with $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dM_t}{dt}=\lambda R_t\end{aligned}$$ where $\lambda$ is a positive
parameter indicating the productivity of the research sector.

-------

Hp: The research sector of the economy is perfectly competitive and, therefore, the profits of the sector are zero. For this reason, each blueprint for its investor is worth the present value of profits, discounted at market interest rate $r$.

----------

For this reason, the flow of profits in the research sector is $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{Pi}{r} \lambda R_t -R_i\end{aligned}$$

---------

This has to be equal to zero. Thus the interest rate needs to satisfy the “research-arbitrage equation” $$\begin{aligned}
r=\lambda\Pi\end{aligned}$$\

--------

Substituting in the growth formula we get $$\begin{aligned}
g=\frac{\lambda\Pi - \rho}{\varepsilon}\end{aligned}$$ 

------

recalling the
equilibrium profit flow $Pi$, we can further substitute, obtaining
finally that $$\begin{aligned}
g = \frac{\lambda\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} L\alpha\frac{2}{1-\alpha} - \rho}{\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$

---------

Romer Model Procedure
=====================

Final good-production function at each date $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i\end{aligned}$$\

---------

Now, let $X_t$ be the total amount of final good used in producing intermediate products. Because of the one-one technology $$\begin{aligned}
X_t = \int_0^{M_t}\mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i\end{aligned}$$

---------

Hp: each intermediate product is produced in the same amount x Then: $$\begin{aligned} Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{\frac{X_t}{M_t}}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i = M_t^{1-\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}X_t^\alpha\end{aligned}$$

----------

The economy’s GDP is final output minus the amount used in the intermediate production $$\begin{aligned} GDP_t= Y_t-X_t\end{aligned}$$\

---------

The monopolist pertaining to each intermediate product maximizes profits at each date, such that $\begin{aligned} \Pi_i = \rho_i x_i - x_i\end{aligned}$ where $\rho_i$ is the price in units of final good and the costs per output are unitary. 

----------

In a perfectly competitive market the price is equal to the marginal product thus we can rewrite the profit function that monopolists’ try to maximize as
$$\begin{aligned}
\Pi_i = \alpha L^{1-\alpha}x_i^\alpha-x_i\end{aligned}$$ 

----------

Therefore, the optimal quantity produced will be $$\begin{aligned} x=L\alpha^{\frac{.2}{1-\alpha}}\end{aligned}$$ 

----------

so the equilibrium profit flow will be $$\begin{aligned} \Pi= \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}L\alpha^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}\end{aligned}$$

----------

Introducing $M_t$ as the measure of product variety we can substitute $X_t = M_t x$ to get the production function $$\begin{aligned} Y_t = M+t L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha\end{aligned}$$ 

-----------

Moreover, GDP is now $GDP_t = M_t (L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha - x)$ 

-----------


The growth rate of GDP is now $$\begin{aligned} g = \frac{1}{M_t} \frac{dM_t}{dt}\end{aligned}$$ 

---------

 $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dM_t}{dt}=\lambda M_t L_2\end{aligned}$$  

---------

 $\lambda$ is a positive parameter indicating the productivity of the research sector.

--------
Hp: The research sector of the economy is perfectly competitive and, therefore,  the profits of the sector are zero. 

---------

For this reason, each blueprint for its  investor is worth the present value of profits, discounted at market interest rate r. 

---------

For this reason, the flow of profits in the research sector is $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{Pi}{r}\lambda M_t L_2 - w_t L_2\end{aligned}$$ This must equal 0. 

----------

Thus the interest rate needs to satisfy the “research-arbitrage equation” $$\begin{aligned} r=\frac{\lambda M_t \Pi}{w_t}\end{aligned}$$ 

----------

To make use of the research-arbitrage equation, we solve for the equilibrium wage rate $w_t$. Since the final sector is perfectly competitive, the wage must
equal the marginal product of labour. 

-----------

Since $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = M_t L_1^{1-\alpha} x^\alpha \rightarrow w_t = \frac{\delta Y_t}{\delta L_1} = (1-\alpha) L^-\alpha_1 M_t x^\alpha\end{aligned}$$

-------------

The equation can then be rewritten using the profit equation previously found and the wage equation such that $$\begin{aligned} r=\alpha\lambda L_1\end{aligned}$$

--------------

Since in the growth formula we get $$\begin{aligned}
g=\lambda L_2 = \lambda(L-L_1)\end{aligned}$$ 

-----------

we have that
$$\begin{aligned}
r=\alpha(\lambda L - g)\end{aligned}$$ 

------------

so substituting $r$ in the Euler Equation we get that $$\begin{aligned} g=\frac{\alpha\lambda L - \rho}{\alpha+\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$

**Conclusion**

- The change in assumptions of the different model yields different growth trajectories
- Romer more accurately notes the impact of different labour
- always pick the correct assignment to turn into a presentation, not just an interesting maths based assignment

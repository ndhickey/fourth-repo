Romer Model Assumptions
=======================

I. Fixed Labour supply $L$ , redistributed between the process of
manufacturing the final good $L_1$ and research $L_2$ so $L_1+ L_2=L$\
II. No intergenerational replacement\
III. No demand for leisure\
Iv. Agents derive utility only from consumption in the form of
$$\begin{aligned}
u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\epsilon}}{1-\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$ V. Constant rate
of time preference $\rho$ for discounting utility\
VI. Final output is produced under perfect competition, using labour and
intermediate inputs\
VII. Each intermediate product is produced using the final good as
input, one for one\
VIII. Each intermediate product is monopolized by the person who created
it\

Production Variety Model Procedure
==================================

A. Final good-production function at each date $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i\end{aligned}$$\
B. Now, let $X_t$ be the total amount of final good used in producing
intermediate products. Because of the one-one technology
$$\begin{aligned}
X_t = \int_0^{M_t}\mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i\end{aligned}$$
Hp: each intermediate product is produced in the same amount x Then:
$$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{\frac{X_t}{M_t}}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i = M_t^{1-\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}X_t^\alpha\end{aligned}$$\
C.The economy’s GDP is final output minus the amount used in the
intermediate production $$\begin{aligned}
GDP_t= Y_t-X_t\end{aligned}$$\
D. The monopolist pertaining to each intermediate product maximizes
profits at each date, such that $$\begin{aligned}
\Pi_i = \rho_i x_i - x_i\end{aligned}$$ where $\rho_i$ is the price in
units of final good and the costs per output are unitary. In a perfectly
competitive market the price is equal to the marginal product thus we
can rewrite the profit function that monopolists’ try to maximize as
$$\begin{aligned}
\Pi_i = \alpha L^{1-\alpha}x_i^\alpha-x_i\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the
optimal quantity produced will be $$\begin{aligned}
x=L\alpha^{\frac{.2}{1-\alpha}}\end{aligned}$$ so the equilibrium profit
flow will be $$\begin{aligned}
\Pi= \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}L\alpha^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}\end{aligned}$$\
E. Introducing $M_t$ as the measure of product variety we can substitute
$X_t = M_t x$ to get the production function $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = M+t L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha\end{aligned}$$ Moreover, GDP is now
$GDP_t = M_t (L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha - x)$ F. The growth rate of GDP is
now $$\begin{aligned}
g = \frac{1}{M_t} \frac{dM_t}{dt}\end{aligned}$$ with $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dM_t}{dt}=\lambda R_t\end{aligned}$$ where $\lambda$ is a positive
parameter indicating the productivity of the research sector.\
G. Hp: The research sector of the economy is perfectly competitive and,
therefore, the profits of the sector are zero. For this reason, each
blueprint for its investor is worth the present value of profits,
discounted at market interest rate $r$.\
For this reason, the flow of profits in the research sector is
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{Pi}{r} \lambda R_t -R_i\end{aligned}$$ This has to be equal to
zero. Thus the interest rate needs to satisfy the “research-arbitrage
equation” $$\begin{aligned}
r=\lambda\Pi\end{aligned}$$\
H. Substituting in the growth formula we get $$\begin{aligned}
g=\frac{\lambda\Pi - \rho}{\varepsilon}\end{aligned}$$ and recalling the
equilibrium profit flow $Pi$, we can further substitute, obtaining
finally that $$\begin{aligned}
g = \frac{\lambda\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} L\alpha\frac{2}{1-\alpha} - \rho}{\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$

Romer Model Procedure
=====================

A. Final good-production function at each date $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i\end{aligned}$$\
B. Now, let $X_t$ be the total amount of final good used in producing
intermediate products. Because of the one-one technology
$$\begin{aligned}
X_t = \int_0^{M_t}\mathrm{x}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i\end{aligned}$$
Hp: each intermediate product is produced in the same amount x Then:
$$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \int_0^{M_t}  \mathrm{\frac{X_t}{M_t}}^{\alpha}_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i = M_t^{1-\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}X_t^\alpha\end{aligned}$$\
C.The economy’s GDP is final output minus the amount used in the
intermediate production $$\begin{aligned}
GDP_t= Y_t-X_t\end{aligned}$$\
D. The monopolist pertaining to each intermediate product maximizes
profits at each date, such that $$\begin{aligned}
\Pi_i = \rho_i x_i - x_i\end{aligned}$$ where $\rho_i$ is the price in
units of final good and the costs per output are unitary. In a perfectly
competitive market the price is equal to the marginal product thus we
can rewrite the profit function that monopolists’ try to maximize as
$$\begin{aligned}
\Pi_i = \alpha L^{1-\alpha}x_i^\alpha-x_i\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the
optimal quantity produced will be $$\begin{aligned}
x=L\alpha^{\frac{.2}{1-\alpha}}\end{aligned}$$ so the equilibrium profit
flow will be $$\begin{aligned}
\Pi= \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}L\alpha^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}\end{aligned}$$\
E. Introducing $M_t$ as the measure of product variety we can substitute
$X_t = M_t x$ to get the production function $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = M+t L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha\end{aligned}$$ Moreover, GDP is now
$GDP_t = M_t (L^{1-\alpha}x^\alpha - x)$ F. The growth rate of GDP is
now $$\begin{aligned}
g = \frac{1}{M_t} \frac{dM_t}{dt}\end{aligned}$$ with $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dM_t}{dt}=\lambda M_t L_2\end{aligned}$$ where $\lambda$ is a
positive parameter indicating the productivity of the research sector.\
G. g) Hp: The research sector of the economy is perfectly competitive
and, therefore, the profits of the sector are zero. For this reason,
each blueprint for its investor is worth the present value of profits,
discounted at market interest rate r. For this reason, the flow of
profits in the research sector is $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{Pi}{r}\lambda M_t L_2 - w_t L_2\end{aligned}$$ This has to be
equal to zero. Thus the interest rate needs to satisfy the
“research-arbitrage equation” $$\begin{aligned}
r=\frac{\lambda M_t \Pi}{w_t}\end{aligned}$$ H. To make use of the
research-arbitrage equation, we solve for the equilibrium wage rate
$w_t$. Since the final sector is perfectly competitive, the wage must
equal the marginal product of labour. Since $$\begin{aligned}
Y_t = M_t L_1^{1-\alpha} x^\alpha \rightarrow w_t = \frac{\delta Y_t}{\delta L_1} = (1-\alpha) L^-\alpha_1 M_t x^\alpha\end{aligned}$$
The equation can then be rewritten using the profit equation previously
found and the wage equation such that $$\begin{aligned}
r=\alpha\lambda L_1\end{aligned}$$ I. Since in the growth formula we get
$$\begin{aligned}
g=\lambda L_2 = \lambda(L-L_1)\end{aligned}$$ we have that
$$\begin{aligned}
r=\alpha(\lambda L - g)\end{aligned}$$ so substituting $r$ in the Euler
Equation we get that $$\begin{aligned}
g=\frac{\alpha\lambda L - \rho}{\alpha+\epsilon}\end{aligned}$$

A discussion on the differences of the Production Variety Model Procedure and the Romer Model Procedure in 3.2.2
================================================================================================================

As can be seen from the above equations, in the simple variant of the
Product-Variety Model, growth increases in conjunction with the
productivity of research, which is measured by the parameter $\lambda$.
Growth is also, positively, dependent on the size of the economy,
measured by the overall labour supply $L$, and it decreases with an
increase in rate of time preference $\rho$. Therefore, if the model
works as expected, we should see that the countries that have a higher
productivity in research sector should have higher growth.\
\
Countries employing more labour in the manufacturing of the good should
show a similar pattern (even though larger countries do not necessarily
grow faster, but perhaps there is a violation of the *ceteris paribus*
condition), while countries in which the inter temporal transfer of
resources is not sufficiently accounted for, there will be a lower
growth, *ceteris paribus*.\
\
The contribution of the Romer model is that it more accurately notes the
implications of different types of labour. Implicit in the Romer model’s
assumptions is that the distribution of labour into the different
sectors, namely, the production of the final goods or in research,
causes growth changes.\
\
First of all, while the growth of product variety in the original model
depended only on the amount of final output used in research multiplied
by some productivity parameter, now the growth of product variety
depends on the amount of labour employed in the research multiplied by
its productivity parameter and accumulated knowledge $M_t$ embodied in
the first design. Hence, in the Romer Model, there are two sources of
increasing returns: specialization, or product differentiation, and
research spill-overs.\
\
Having isolated these sources of increasing returns one must consider
what impact this has on our conclusions concerning growth determination.
As the last equation shows, even in the Romer model, growth depends
positively on productivity of research and total labour supply and
negatively on time preference. The difference here is that, as
intermediate firms do not internalize the contributions of product
diversity and research spill-overs, the equilibrium growth rate is
always less than the social optimal. This is owing to the intermediary
firms not being compensated for the positive externalities of their
production to the point at their marginal private benefit will equal the
marginal social benefit. If there were subsidies to research, or
subsidies to capital inputs (because of the monopoly, the economy is not
using as many units of the capital inputs, so giving a subsidy to final
good producers would also increase growth rate), the equilibrium growth
rate may be increased to the optimal quantity.\
